## Prayer

**In the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.**

God our Father, you are our saviour, and our creator.
Guide us to learn, and to listen, during this school year. May this year be of one of the best, even if it is not the most usual.
Help us to ensure this year does not take us down. Instead, let this year enrich and strengthen all our aspects, mentally, physically, and most importantly, spiritually.
May we learn to get accustomed to this type of learning, whether we are familiar with it, or not.

We make this prayer to you, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

**Amen.**

What does being a Catholic Learner mean to you?

What I think being a Catholic Learner means is to,

* **Be faithful**
* **Be responsible**
* **Be respectful**

**Be Faithful**
I think having Faith in God is very important when it comes to being a Catholic Learner. Faith allows us to have strength and to be closer to God.

**Be Responsible**
I think being responsible is also very important to being a Catholic Learner.
Responsibility allows us to be more truthful as we take responsibility for our actions.

**Be Respectful**
I think being respectful is another important act to be a Catholic Learner.
Being respectful means to be polite, kind, and thoughtful.

* **Stay positive** 
* **Have faith and trust in each other and yourself**
* **Be respectful to each other**

With a focus on community, please complete the following:

Using the Show What You Know Student Choice Board below, develop an original prayer that you would be willing to share with your teachers and peers.

Your prayer should speak to what it means to be a Catholic learner who embraces his/her potential while understanding the importance of being a culturally responsive learner and responsible citizen who gives witness to Catholic social teaching by promoting peace, justice and the sacredness of human life.

**God our Father,
You are the Kings of Kings and you are our healer.

**Thank you for all you have given me, and this year, I will try my best to embrace the potential you have given me, while still understanding importance of being a responsive learner and responsible citizen, and to give witness to Catholic social teaching by promoting peace, justice, and the sacredness of human life.

**I am thankful for this year, even if wasn't the most usual. **


**I make this prayer to you, Christ our Lord.**

Using the Show What You Know Student Choice Board share one critical aspect of yourself that you would like to celebrate and share with your teachers and peers. **You can create a short audio recording, video, collage or photo presentation. Be creative. Showcase your God given gifts and talents. **


I assume this means one important part of me I want other people to know.

I think that one important part of me is that I am (sometimes) creative
