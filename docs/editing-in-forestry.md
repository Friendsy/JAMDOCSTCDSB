What does being a Catholic Learner mean to you?

What I think being a Catholic Learner means is to,

* **Be faithful
* **Be responsible
* **Be respectful

**Be Faithful**
I think having Faith in God is very important when it comes to being a Catholic Learner. Faith allows us to have strength and to be closer to God.

**Be Responsible**
I think being responsible is also very important to being a Catholic Learner.
Responsibility allows us to be more truthful as we take responsibility for our actions.

I think being respectful is another important act to be a Catholic Learner.
Being respectful means to be polite, kind, and thoughtful.
