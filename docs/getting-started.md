## Intro

**If there are any grammar or language errors, please tell me.**

I have created this website because the TCDSBVS Student Orientation Experience Daily Topics has this 'Show What You Know: Student Choice Board,' which has an option for **WEBSITE DESIGN,** and since I can make a "website," might as well make a website.

**Why is the name cse.ddns.net?**

I don't know. I just wanted a short name.
**If your wondering what "cse" stands for, it means Catholic School Education. I just abbreviated it.**
**I could have put it as tcdsb.ddns.net, but this is not an official board website, nor does it represent the board.**
this is where i put the answers to the topic.

**Why am I here?**
I don't know, why are you here?

**But that wasn't an answer to my question?**
Why are you here?

**Why is there a Q&A here?**
I just put it.

**Difference between 'http' and 'https'?**
'http' stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
'https' stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol **Secure.**
Since most browsers mark http websites as **Not Secure,** I used Netlify for this website since they provide free SSL Certificates with your website and a custom domain. This website is proudly using **https.**

**Why can't I access this website on some of my other devices or on another WIFI network?**
This is mainly due to DNS Propagation, since it takes time to update DNS.
If you want to view this website faster, you can flush your DNS Cache.

**What is DNS?**
DNS transalates domain names,(for example, google.ca) to IP addresses so browsers can load internet resources. Think of it as the Phonebook of the internet.

**This is the end of the Q&A, haha.**
